Week 4: NLP Disaster Tweets Kaggle Mini-Project

This repository contains my submission for the Kaggle "Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets" competition, completed as part of a peer-graded assignment.

## Overview
The goal is to classify tweets as disaster-related or not using NLP techniques. The notebook includes EDA, model building (LSTM), hyperparameter tuning, and analysis.

## Setup
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/`
2. Run the notebook: `jupyter notebook w4-nlp.ipynb`
3. Data: Use the Kaggle dataset at `/kaggle/input/nlp-getting-started`.

## Files
- `w4-nlp.ipynb`: Main notebook with EDA, modeling, and analysis.
- `submission.csv`: Kaggle submission file.
- `leaderboard_screenshot.png`: Screenshot of my Kaggle leaderboard position.

## Results
Achieved a validation F1-score of ~0.79 and a Kaggle F1-score of [TBD] (after submission).
